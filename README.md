################## Introduction to VMR ######################
Vehicle Manufacturer Recognition(VMR) is a popular vision-based system widely used in secure access, vehicle verification and traffic monitoring applications. This paper proposes an investigation into recognizing the make of a car from its brand logo. Recognizing an automobileâ€™s make is a challenging task due to lack of discriminative features and close appearance of automobile logos. This paper presents a relatively simple algorithm using cross-correlation to detect the logo location and recognize the make of car in the given image. This algorithm is assessed on a set of 300 test images(self-created dataset) and has resulted in promising accuracy for logo detection as well as recognition.
